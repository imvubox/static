It's hard to tell zeros and O's apart. The letters are too darn close. There is a reason that web designers use tools that display their codes in monospace fonts - it's easier to read and manipulate.  In this code, I'm going to show you how to change ALL your HTML/CSS/JS editors back to monospace.  The text box where you enter your codes is called a &quot;textarea&quot;, and by default it IS monospace, but IMVU changed that with their default CSS, for what reason I don't know.  Here is how to change it to something better.

Include the code below in any HTML editor panel.  Since IMVU uses jQuery on home pages for IMVU.avatarCard, there's no need to add the script reference to jQuery anymore.

Note: If you've already included a script reference to jQuery hosted on Google, you don't need to include that more than once.  It doesn't hurt to add it more than once though.

The two things you can modify are the font-family and font-size. I usually use &quot;em&quot; sizes because they scale better at different page resolutions.  I am using Lucida Console as my monospace font, but there are a few others that work on Windows:

'Courier New' (all Windows)
'Lucida Console' (Windows XP and above)
'Lucida Sans Typewriter' (Windows XP and above)
'Consolas' (Windows Vista and 7, I think)

I think it would be cool if IMVU would give us a floating window with more space to edit our codes, instead of the little tiny window.  Maybe I'll come up with a way to do that.

</a><a href="content/deny-badge-auto-grant-with-redirect" class="list-group-item hidden" data-search="Deny Badge Auto-Grant with Redirect OK, let's say you plunked down 100K credits on a badge, and you find it isn't helping sales, really?  What is an avatar to do?  All the leeches want freebies, but are not playing the game to your advantage.  Well, you can charge them for the badge by redirecting them to a product page instead of granting the badge when they click &quot;Request Badge&quot;.  The trick is to disconnect the JavaScript that grants the badge, and substitute it with the JavaScript that -you- want to run.

The technical trick here is that your JavaScript will typically run -before- the click event handler is added to the badge.  The way to get around that is to place your code in a jQuery $(document).ready() statement, so that it doesn't run until -after- the badge granting code has been attached.  And IMVU conveniently uses at least 2 JavaScript frameworks (YUI and jQuery) you can piggyback on.  And since the event is attached to the button using YUI, you have to use YUI to remove it.

To use this code you need to do the following:
* Make sure your badge(s) are set to Auto-Grant on.
* Change myIMVUID to your own ID
* Change the productID to one of yours
* Change the badge numbers in the comma delimited list.  They are numbered sequentially starting at 1.  If you only have one badge, just use [1] with no commas inside.

That's it! It's up to you what you want your product page to say and do.  I'll tell that if they buy a product with real credits (not promo) and PM me, they'll get the badge.  I think that's fair, don't you?">

</a><a href="content/change-any-panel-title" class="list-group-item hidden" data-search="Change Any Panel Title This code uses jQuery and JavaScript to change any panel title on your page.  It works in all browsers and because jQuery is hosted on Google, it is very reliable.

In the example below, I'm changing the text for &quot;Special Someone&quot; to &quot;The Love of My Life&quot;.  The id for the Special Someone panel is #special_panel.  The text you want to replace it with is inside the .text('What to Put There') clause.  Make sure the panel always starts with a pound sign (#) and that the text is surrounded by quotation marks. This code will work anywhere in your home page, it doesn't matter which custom HTML panel you put it in.

I'll show you how to do other useful tweaks using jQuery in the future.  If you have a particular thing you'd like to change, please let me know!  PM me at my page: http://avatars.imvu.com/Cheri :D

(Updated.) The first step is to make sure you have your 'My Videos' panel enabled onto your homepage. To do that just click 'Account' located at the top right corner, next to your username name. From there scroll down the page until you see 'Panel Visibility Settings.' Then find the 'My Videos' box located at the bottom of the list. Make sure that is changed from 'Off' to 'Everyone'. Step two is to find the video you want, anyone will do. After you find the one your want click the 'Share' button located right under the video. Then click 'Embed.' Now that you've done that, you should see a highlighted code. Now, the size of the video is going to be pretty large, so I suggest you make it smaller by changing the width=&quot;560&quot; and height=&quot;315&quot; to something a little smaller, I'm using the size width=&quot;250&quot; and height=&quot;150&quot;. Once you've got your desired size, look for the
'?rel=0' bit of the code, and change that to 'autoplay=1' (without the quotes.) Then copy the whole code and just paste it in your videos box, you can do that by clicking 'edit' on your videos panel and then clicking 'edit custom HTML/CSS' then just pasting your code into that box that pops up, then hit save, and you're finished!

You should have: &quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/jjNhVDueVnY&amp;&quot;

</a><a href="content/page-background-slideshow" class="list-group-item hidden" data-search="Page Background Slideshow This script allows you to change the page background periodically, like a slideshow.  I won't get into the details of how it works, but I'll show you how to use it.

You can change delaySeconds to any number greater than 0, that's the time between slides.

You can change shuffle to either true (random order) or false (in a repeating sequence).

The image files are specified by &quot;prefix&quot; and &quot;files&quot;.  Prefix is the part of the URL that the images have in common.  Files are the parts of the URL that are different for each file.  So it's recommended to upload all your images to the same folder on the server, and use the same image hosting server for all the images.

If you want to see an example of this in action, check out my page at http://avatars.imvu.com/Cheri

I haven't figured out how to do slide transition effects yet - I'm working on that now!

</a><a href="content/badge-auto-grant---catalog-page-view" class="list-group-item hidden" data-search="Badge Auto-grant -&gt; Catalog Page View Giving away badges is great, but are they helping direct traffic to your catalog page?  If not, try this code. Whenever someone auto-grants him/herself, the price they pay is a redirection to your catalog page.  Oh, they still get the badge, but you never know, someone might actually make a purchase, too.

The first line of script is where you specify your IMVU avatar ID number.  This is used to identify the badge granting button the user clicks, and also the URL for your catalog page.

The second line is a list of badge numbers.  In IMVU, your badges are numbered XXXXXXX-YY where XXXXXXX is your IMVU avatar ID, and YY is the badge number.  I only have one badge, but I assume IMVU is numbering them consecutively.  If you have multiple badges, use [1,2,3,4] as your array.  If you only have 1 badge, just use [1] to create an array with one element.  If you are unsure about your badge numbering, open up your HP using Google Chrome, and right click the badge button and select &quot;Inspect Element&quot; - the ID will show up there in the HTML.

The next line is a for loop that iterates through the badge numbers you specified in your array.  The next line, we use IMVU's YUI code to attach an extra event to the button click of the &quot;grant-badge-XXXXXXX-YY&quot; element.  This opens up your product page in a new tab (for most people) or a new window.

Let me know if you have any issues or questions, thanks! Cheri http://avatars.imvu.com/Cheri">

Some fonts are pervasive, such as Arial, Courier New, Verdana, Georgia, and Times New Roman.  More specialized fonts may not work on other people's computers if they don't have that font installed, so what looks great in your own computer's web browser might look terrible on someone else's.

Fortunately, CSS has the ability to import fonts for use on your page from anywhere on the web.  Google has been gracious enough to let us web designers use 648 fonts for free, just go to Google Fonts to see.  Find the font you like, then click the &quot;Quick Use&quot; icon to see the @import CSS code to put in your &lt;style&gt; block (as shown below).  Then you can use that font anywhere in your page, either through changing the CSS codes, or using the inline style=&quot;...&quot; attribute.">

</a><a href="content/single-column-layout-with-jquery" class="list-group-item hidden" data-search="Single Column Layout with jQuery What it does: After your home page is loaded, this code will rearrange your panels into a single column format.  It does this by removing the &quot;rightColumn&quot; and placing it underneath the &quot;leftColumn&quot;, then resizing the columns for a better fit.

You can move your panels around within this single column (actually stacked column) layout.  When you move a panel, it will snap back to its original size while you're moving it.  The next time the page loads, the panels will be the right width.  You'll probably have to rearrange your stickers after this.

You can place this code in any Custom HTML/CSS editor and it will work.  You can change the value of newWidth from 900 to whatever you like, but 900 pixels is the size of the original 2-column format.

You can check out my page for an idea of what this looks like.

I think that's pretty lame, but I found a way around it, so you can see their About Me information even if they've &quot;removed&quot; it.

You have to be on the user's home page for this trick to work.  This isn't really a code you would put on your page, but it's a handy tip.

First you need to find the user's ID number.  If you hover your mouse over the &quot;Name Change History&quot; link, and look at the URL in the status bar on the bottom, the number at the end of this URL is their ID.  Remember this or write it down. (A URL is a web address in the form &quot;http://www.server.com/some/page&quot;, in case you're new to this.)

Then in the Address Box of your browser (the place up top where you can type a URL) type the following:

javascript:IMVU.AvatarCard.showPopup(25522141);

and press enter.  My ID is 25522141, but you can put any ID in place of it and the avatar card for that user will show up.  You have to type it with the same capitalization I used or it won't work.

</a><a href="content/js-slideshow-for-product-pages" class="list-group-item hidden" data-search="JS Slideshow for Product Pages Intro:

I have been playing with jQuery, and I figured out how to create a slideshow using just JavaScript and images hosted on a third-party server.  No Flash is required!  Each image fades out while the next image fades in, and you can cycle through the images or display them at random.  Best of all, it works on all modern browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome and Opera).

*** NOTE ***
I've just created a code generator for my slideshows.  If you want to use it, check out the following page:
http://www.triggerless.com/imvu/slide_ex.htm
*** NOTE ***

How to use it:

In your product page 'Edit Settings', insert the following HTML code:

(It's in the code section)

Now you are going to have to edit the options for your own pictures.

You probably don't need to edit the value for boxWidth, this is 910 by default, the width of the IFRAME where your product description is displayed.

You WILL want to change the imageHeight and ImageWidth values so they correspond to your image.  You can also use this to shrink your images if you like, but if you don't keep the same aspect ratio, your images will look distorted.

The value for &quot;path&quot; is the base URL to your images, minus the specific file name.  If you have an account in Photobucket or somewhere else, you should use that.  The trailing slash (/) is optional, the script will put it there if required.

The important one is &quot;files&quot;.  This is enclosed in square braces [] and is a comma-delimited list of file names, and each file name is enclosed in single quotes.  The script combines the &quot;path&quot; value with each of the &quot;files&quot; values to come up with the full URL of the images to display.

You can change the backgroundColor, too, so it matches the rest of your product page.  You can use named colors like 'black' or 'aliceblue', or RGB values like '#990066'.  Make sure to include the pound sign (#) for RGB values.

There are two delays, swapDelay and fadeDelay, that are in milliseconds.  The swapDelay determines how long to wait before changing images.  The fadeDelay determines how long the fading animation will last.  You can play with these numbers until you get an effect you like.

Finally, there are two possible values for 'method', those are 'cycle' and 'random'.  Cycle will start at the first image and cycle through the files in sequence, and loop back to the beginning.  Random will pick the images at random, except it won't show the same image twice in a row.

I plan on adding new features to the script.  I'm hosting it on www.triggerless.com, but if you would rather host it on your own server, feel free to download it and use it.

Love,
Cheri

Update(1/20/2010): I've added support for a new option called 'onSwap' for JavaScript gurus.  If you don't understand what an 'event' is, you probably should skip over this.  Now my script will fire an event called onSwap, and you can add a callback function to execute every time the images swap.  The syntax is like this:

var o_options = {
        // all the other options
        onSwap: function() { /* your code goes here */ }
};">

To make it bigger just change it to 500 or 550 or more but if u put it like to 1000 thats honestly too big..lol) AND to make it Wider (change the number &quot;500&quot; to any number depending on how small or big u want it, IF you want the width smaller change it to 400 or 450 or less, or if you want it bigger change it to 600 or 650 or more depending on how wide u want it.)
